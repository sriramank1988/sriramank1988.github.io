1. Intro :

You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

2. DEVELOPMENT :

Technologies Used:
Html
CSS
Javascript

Planning:

Figured out in my mind that I will be using 3 boxes in 3 different flex wrap and started to work on project immediately.
Developed using Agile methodology with time box on a daily basis.
day 1 : developed basic protype for 2 players, letting the players take a spot if it is available and checking for winning condition.
day 2 : added score for each round, reset and return to home screen options. also developed a simple computer response for 1 player mode. picks an empty spot in random when player makes a move.
day 3 : started to develop a better response for player move and it is still a Work in progress.
day 4 : little house keeping to make sure everything works fine for all posible inputs and some color changes.

3. Challenges :

Fixed :

1. Added wait functionality for computer response and when the wait function was running, the game was accepting human response. fixed by adding a guard condition by accepting human response only when he gets his turn in Dom message.
2. Had trouble finding a tie condition and solved using a counter.

Work in Progess :

1. Better response functionality is still in progress but doesnot break the functionality of the game because of using a fallback by calling the random pick functionality.

-----------------------------------------------------
4. Lessons :

    1. Unable to think of abstraction immediately. developed functions only after seeing the set of codes were repeated again.
    2. keeping fallback condition is a good idea to ensure the program doen't break.
